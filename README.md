## 🧠 What I do

I’m a hands-on engineer and a strong believer in project-based learning. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I love building things that do things. Whether it's flipping vinyl records with a custom PCB, designing hardware to monitor infrastructure health, or using AI to detect pneumonia from X-rays, I enjoy building..things

## 🌱 Outside the Breadboard

I care about nature and music. I’ve helped plant over 1,200 trees, and I hope to some day work on sustainable technology. Drumming is also one of my biggest hobbies, so let me know if you want to jam. For my next project, I want to design a custom board that can manipulate audio signals to create unique electronic music effects, like a compact DJ deck that experiments with sound in creative, signal-driven ways.

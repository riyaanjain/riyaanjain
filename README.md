# 👋 Hi, I’m Riyaan

Welcome. Here, I like to show-off some of the cool things I've worked on, in the most humble way possible.

## 🧠 What I do

I’m a hands-on engineer and a strong believer in project-based learning. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I love building things that... do things. Whether it's flipping vinyl records with a custom PCB, syncing motors and sensors for automated imaging, or using AI to detect pneumonia from X-rays... I enjoy building... things.

📍 Currently based in Urbana, IL  
🎓 Graduating May 2025

## 💼 Some Things I'm Working On

- **[Automatic Vinyl Record Flipper](https://github.com/riyaanjain/VinylRecordFlipper)**  
  My personal DJ (almost). An ESP32-powered system that automatically switches sides of vinyl records.

- **Smart Imaging Systems**  
  Designing circuits for automated focus-stacking systems that sync motors and light controls to measure particles.

- **Foldable Electric Skateboard**  
  Building the PCB for a foldable electric skateboard startup.

## 🌱 Outside the Breadboard

I care about nature, sustainability, and music. I’ve helped plant over 1,200 trees, and I hope to one day live somewhere in the mountains, working on green tech and building a life that blends nature and engineering. Drumming is also one of my biggest hobbies, so let me know if you want to jam

## 🧠 What I do

I’m a hands-on engineer and a strong believer in project-based learning. I chosee to study Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to turn a lifelong love of building things into something real. Since then, I've built everything from an automated vinyl record flipper to IoT nodes for structural health monitoring, so I'm happy to say that I'm doing what I love!!

## 💼 Some Things I've Worked On

- **[Automated Vinyl Record Flipper](https://github.com/riyaanjain/VinylRecordFlipper)**: My music butler. An ESP32-powered system that automatically switches sides of vinyl records.

-  **Structural Health Monitoring IoT Device**: I am currently the lead hardware engineer and responsible for all PCB design at StructureIQ Inc. I can't share my board designs as that's confidential, but trust me, they're so cool...
  
- **Foldable Electric Skateboard**: I helped design the PCB for a foldable electric skateboard at eFold Electronics.

## 🌱 Outside the Breadboard

I care about nature and music. I’ve helped raised thousands of dollars for environmental initiatives, and I hope to some day work on sustainable technology. I also love playing the drums and DJing, so let me know if you want to jam. For my next personal project, I want to design a custom PCB that can manipulate audio signals to create unique electronic music effects, like an audio board that experiments with sound in creative, signal-driven ways.

# 👋 Hi, I’m Riyaan Jain

Welcome to my corner of the internet — where vinyl records meet voltage rails, and circuits come alive with a bit of code and a lot of curiosity.

## 🧠 Who I Am

I’m a hands-on engineer currently studying Computer Engineering at UIUC, with a love for building things that spin, move, blink, or do something useful (or just fun). Whether it's flipping records automatically with a PCB I designed or syncing motors with sensors for particle imaging, I’m all about making hardware do cool stuff.

📍 Currently based in Urbana, IL  
🎓 Graduating May 2025

## 💼 What I Work On

- **Automatic Vinyl Record Flipper**  
  A fully automated ESP32-powered system that lifts, rotates, and drops records like a robotic DJ.

- **Smart Imaging Systems**  
  Designing circuits for automated focus-stacking systems that sync motors and light controls to measure particles — like lab automation, but way cooler.

- **Foldable Electric Skateboard**  
  Building the power, control, and safety circuitry for a foldable e-board that balances speed and smarts.

## 🛠 Skills & Tools

- PCB Design (KiCad, SPICE)  
- Embedded C, Python, MATLAB  
- ESP32, Arduino, STM32  
- Signal processing, power electronics, and circuit debugging  
- Soldering things that probably shouldn’t be soldered at 2am

## 🌱 Outside the Breadboard

I care about nature, sustainability, and long walks with good conversations. I’ve helped plant over 1,200 trees, and I hope to one day live somewhere sunny in the mountains, working on green tech and building a life that blends nature and engineering.
